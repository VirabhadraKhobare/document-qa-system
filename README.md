# DOC\_QA System

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](#license) [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue)](#requirements) [![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/streamlit-ready-orange)](#demo)

A sleek, production-minded Document Question‑Answering (DocQA) system: upload PDFs (and other docs), embed the content, and ask natural‑language questions — powered by open-source embeddings/LLMs and an easy Streamlit-based UI. Built to be readable, secure, and extendable for devs who like clean code and fast experiments.

> **Why this repo?**
>
> Developers love it when a README is a map — short, beautiful, and actionable. This repo gives you just that: a ready-to-run demo, clear architecture, and the pieces you need to extend the system (vector DB, retrieval, safety filters, and a small web UI).

## 🎯 Key features

* Upload PDFs, DOCX, and plain text files.
* Convert documents into embeddings for fast semantic search (FAISS/Chroma-compatible).
* Natural-language question answering over documents using an LLM (plug-and-play).
* Streamlit demo UI for immediate interaction.
* Simple safety patterns: allow-listing, query length limits, and read-only DB by default.

## 📦 Quick demo (one-liner)

```bash
# create venv, install, run the app
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` and try uploading a PDF.

## 🧭 How it works (high level)

1. **Ingest**: uploaded files are parsed into text chunks (pdfminer / pypdf / tika / custom parser).
2. **Embed**: each chunk is converted into a vector using your embedding model (sentence-transformers or hosted embeddings).
3. **Store**: vectors are stored in a vector store (FAISS / Chroma / Milvus) for similarity search.
4. **Retrieve**: on user query, retrieve top‑K relevant chunks.
5. **Answer**: send the retrieved context + user question to an LLM to produce a concise answer and cite source chunks.

## 🚀 Quick local setup

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` (or set env vars) with keys like `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or whichever LLM/embedding provider you use).

4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🔧 Typical configuration (env)

```env
# set which embedding & LLM providers to use
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=sentence-transformers
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
VECTOR_STORE=faiss
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=1000
CHUNK_OVERLAP=200
```

---

## 🧪 Example usage (from the UI)

1. Upload `example.pdf`.
2. Wait for ingestion & embedding (first run will cache the vector store).
3. Ask: **"What are the main limitations mentioned about the study's methodology?"**
4. Get a short answer with source snippets and confidence info.

---

## ✅ Best practices & safety

* Always run the model in a sandboxed environment when possible (no destructive DB ops).
* Use allow-lists for docs or restrict which datasets the model can see in production.
* Cache embeddings and retrieval results to lower cost and latency.
* Limit the number of tokens sent to LLM by summarizing or truncating contexts.

## 📜 Example minimal `requirements.txt`

```
streamlit>=1.20
python-dotenv
pypdf
pdfminer.six
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
openai
langchain>=0.2.0  # optional, helpful abstractions
```

> Tailor this list to the exact models and vector store you prefer.

---

## 🧩 Extensibility ideas

* Replace the embedding backend (OpenAI embeddings, Cohere, or local sentence-transformers).
* Add OCR for scanned PDFs (Tesseract or AWS Textract).
* Add per-document permissions or multi-user sessions for collaboration.
* Export answers with source citations to Markdown/HTML.
